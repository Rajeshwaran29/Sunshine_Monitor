Hi I am Rajeshwaran,

Thanks for giving me this opportunity to attend the assessment session for the position of Full-Stack developer . I have done my assessment with all my knowledge and efforts . I want to inform one thing for the Front-end you want to use Flutter + React native instead I uses the HTML , CSS and JavaScript for the Project and for the Back-end you need to done it with FAST API but I done the assessment with Flask framework and I am not well qualified in Figma too. I know that I am unable to satisfy the criteria from your side but believe me I am a quick learner and if I get this chance I will definitely learn the knowledge that you want and I am sure about this. Once again Thank you for your time for the consideration. I hope that I can get the call from your side . 

Thank You , Have a Nice Day
